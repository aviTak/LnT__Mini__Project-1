## SWOT ANALYSIS

* ### Strengths
Assessing a students's details strengths, areas in which it is already successful, includes looking at staff skills and competencies, programming, budget maintenance and community relations. Planning for the student's management system future based on its strengths should include ways to maintain and improve existing success.

* ### Weaknesses
Analyzing a student management system's weaknesses also means evaluating internal operations. G. Edward Evans and Patricia Layzell Ward, authors of "Management Basics for Information Professionals," point out that weaknesses may lie in the same areas as strengths. Careful analysis of old student management  system weaknesses suggests which areas need improvement. Weaknesses also identify areas that need attention to reduce the negative impact of their weaknesses.

* ### Opportunities
Factors outside the student itself should be evaluated to see what could be acted upon to benefit the library. Student Management opportunities may present themselves in "economic, political/legal, technological, or sociocultural environments," says Anthony C. Danca in his analysis of SWOT. For example, awareness of a high economic status of the library's main patron base provides a population likely to participate in fund-raising activities.

* ### Threats
Analyzing student management threats also means evaluating factors outside the student that hinder its success. Like opportunities, many threats stem from the economic and political environment, says Danca. For example, economic downturns threaten to reduce the budgets of publicly funded managements. Maintaining current awareness of threats allows the student administration to plan and act. This area requires frequent attention because the external environment often changes quickly.

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:
**Government and private  schools Providing details to students**



## What:
**Building an automated student management system to have a safe and secure record of student detailed entries in a company or in a school.**



## When:
**SIMS was an early MIS for schools. (The earliest MIS for schools was developed in 1978 by Raymond Bily while he was a student at Asheville High School, in Asheville, NC.) It was initially developed by Philip Neal, a teacher at Lea Manor High School, from 1982 to 1983. Bedfordshire County Council (Lea Manor's local education authority) then further developed the product, which began being used by other schools in 1984.**



## Where:
**This problem is expected to surface in all educational sectors.**


## How:
**This problem may cause ineffective  management and hence there can be a huge amount of data redundancy and time wastage and also loss of information.**
